Unix Binary Packages
Many Linux and BSD distributions have their own packages of Pygame. These may have an older version of Pygame than the wheels, but have been carefully tested with other packages in that distribution.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo apt-get install python3-pygame

Fedora/Red hat
sudo yum install python3-pygame
